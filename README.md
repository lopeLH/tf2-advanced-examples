The encoder uses pooling to reduce spatial dimensions while increasing the number of channels. The decoder uses transposed convolutions to upscale feature maps to the original resolution. Skip-connections from the encoder to the decoder help the decoder by providing local details. | [Unet.ipynb](https://www.google.com) |
