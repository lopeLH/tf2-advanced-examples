The encoder uses pooling to reduce spatial dimensions while increasing the number of channels. The decoder uses transposed convolutions to upscale feature maps to the original resolution. Skip-connections from the encoder to the decoder help the decoder by providing local details. | [notebook](https://www.google.com) |

[(link)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114v10) | Autoencoder architecture where the learned encodings are the mean and variance vectors of a multidimensional normal distribution with diagonal covariance. Training is done with a reconstruction loss plus a KL-loss to pull the encodings towards the standard normal. This makes the model learn a continuous embedding space where interpolation between samples is meaningful. Can be used as a generative model.| [notebook](https://www.google.com) |
